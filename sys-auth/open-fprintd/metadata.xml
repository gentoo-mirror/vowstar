	This is the middleware to access fingerprint readers. This is the fprintd
	replacement which allows you to have your own backend as a standalone
	service. This is work in progress. Install and use at your own risc.
	At this point this project does not enforce any auth checks against
	requests made on DBus.
	Existing architecture of fprintd and libfprint does not allow loosely
	coupled integration with 3rd party drivers. This is done on purpose to
	force hardware vendors to contribute their drivers as an open source.
	Unfortunately this approach prevents open source projects, 
	(like python-validity) to be integrated with the rest of the stack without
	creating a shim which could be exploited by the vendors to create a binary
	driver distributions. open-fprintd will allow anyone to contribute a
	backend implementation. I rust the end user should be responsible for
	making a choice between an open source driver and a binary blob provided by
	a hardware vendor. They have already chosen Linux over Windows anyway.
