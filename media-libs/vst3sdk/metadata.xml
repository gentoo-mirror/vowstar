		A VST plug-in is an audio processing component that is utilized within
		a host application. This host application provides the audio or/and
		event streams that are processed by the plug-in's code. Generally
		speaking, a VST plug-in can take a stream of audio data, apply a
		process to the audio, and return the result to the host application.
		A VST Plug-in performs its process normally using the processor of the
		computer. The audio stream is broken down into a series of blocks.
		The host supplies the blocks in sequence. The host and its current
		environment control the block-size. The VST Plug-in maintains the
		status of all its own parameters relating to the running process:
		The host does not maintain any information about what the Plug-in did
		with the last block of data it processed.
