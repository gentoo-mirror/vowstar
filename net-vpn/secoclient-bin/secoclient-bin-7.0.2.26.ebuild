	# You must *personally verify* that this trick doesn't install

	# This is the preferred way to install.

	# When you hit a failure with emake, do not just use make. It is
	# better to fix the Makefiles to allow proper parallelization.
	# If you fail with that, use "emake -j1", it's still better than make.

	# For Makefiles that don't make proper use of DESTDIR, setting
	# prefix is often an alternative.  However if you do this, then
	# you also need to specify mandir and infodir, since they were
	# passed to ./configure as absolute paths (overriding the prefix
	# setting).

	# 	infodir="${D}"/usr/share/info \
	# 	libdir="${D}"/usr/$(get_libdir) \
	# 	install
	# Again, verify the Makefiles!  We don't want anything falling
	# outside of ${D}.
